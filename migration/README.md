# NetBox migration

Welcome to the documentation of the migration chart for Netbox that use a bundle postgresql database.

> **Important**  
> The migration chart only works with a Netbox instance that uses the bundle postgresql database.

## TL;DR

For those busy people ðŸ˜‰, here is a short and sweet version of what to do. Fill the \[blank\] and sit back for a couple of minutes while it setups a new Netbox instance with the data already migrated for you.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kyramee/netbox-openshift.git
./netbox-openshift/migration/script/migration.sh [netboxPassword] [postgresPassword] -r [redisPassword]
```
## How does it work
For us, ladies and gentlemen who have a little bit of time on their hands, here is how the chart works:

### Step one: Intalling the migration chart
The migration helm chart install 4 resources:
- **[Job](templates/job.yaml)**: The Job will fetch a backup of the previous Netbox instance. This component is dependent on the image generated by the netbox-migration project.

- **[PVC](templates/pvc.yaml)**: The persistent volume that will hold the Netbox backup for the new netbox instance.

- **[ServiceAccount](templates/serviceaccount.yaml)**: The privileged account that will allow the job to pull the needed image from the netbox-migration project.

- **[RoleBinding](templates/rolebinding.yaml)**: The configuration that binds the system:image-puller of the netbox-migration project to the ServiceAccount.

As stated above, the Job depends on an image stored in another project and this is by design. Using this image, the Job saves a backup of the current Netbox inside the persistent volume that will then be mounted on the bundle postgresql container. The image contains the private SSH key needed to connect to the current Netbox instance. So using a prebuilt image is more secure than having to regenerate or copying all over the place the private SSH key. 

### Step two: Installing the Netbox chart
After the migration Job has successfully run, the Netbox instance will be installed with the one caveat that the [postgres values file](posgresql.yaml) will be included in the installation. This file will override some of the default configuration of the bundle postgresql chart like adding the volume with the Netbox backup.

As for the Netbox configuration, a dedicated documentation is available [here](../netbox/README.md#configuration).

### Step three: Housekeeping
When the Netbox instance is installed, a helm upgrade command without adding the [postgres values file](posgresql.yaml) will be run in order to remove any migration configuration from the posgresql pod. Then, all migration resources installed in step one will be removed and the helm chart uninstalled.

## How does it work, but for dev
Congratulation to all the ladies and gentlemen that made it this far ðŸŽ‰ and, if you skipped the first "How does it work" section, you are strongly encouraged to take an extra 5 minutes to read it because some explanations may be unclear without the added context of the previous section.

This section will expend the notion seen above with a developer perspective.

### Step one: Intalling the migration chart
By default, the helm tool will install the resources in a [predetermine order](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-install-installing-a-package), but with the help of [hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/#helm) it is possible add a before and after install step.

Due to some reasons, probably related to the compatibility between Helm and OpenShift, when some resources are not working as intended when installed in the same install step. So in order to make everything work together the migration helm chart will install 4 resources in this orders using hooks:
1. **[ServiceAccount](templates/serviceaccount.yaml)**: Installed in the "pre-install" step.

2. **[RoleBinding](templates/rolebinding.yaml)**: Installed in the "pre-install" step.
   > **Important**  
   > The RoleBinding is intalled in the **netbox-migration** namespace and not in the current namespace. Read [Allowing pods to reference images across projects](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html#images-allow-pods-to-reference-images-across-projects_using-image-pull-secrets) from the OpenShift

3. **[PVC](templates/pvc.yaml)**: Installed in the normal installation step.

4. **[Job](templates/job.yaml)**: Installed in the "post-install" step.

When the helm install command is done, a housekeeping script is generate by the [NOTES.txt file](templates/NOTES.txt). More details on the script will be given in step three, but be aware that the script is generetate on step one.

### Step two: Installing the Netbox chart
Since all configurations and technicals details are available in the Netbox chart documentation, there is not much to say here. Just keep in mind that the [postgres values file](posgresql.yaml) already defines some of the value of postgres chart. If you were to define the same values in another value file, conflict will arise and one will be overwritten.

### Step three: Housekeeping
Helm uninstall command is limited to namespace where the chart was installed. Meaning that any resources installed in anothers namespace will not be remove.

In order to facilitate the housekeeping step, a label named housekeeping with a random 20 caracter long string as value is added to all resources. This label will be use as selector to delete all migration resources with the script generated by the [NOTES.txt](templates/NOTES.txt) template. The housekeeping label value must be unique in order to avoid deleting unrelated resources with the same housekeeping label.
